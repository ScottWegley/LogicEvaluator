# LogicEvaluator
This is a project I've had in the back of my head for almost five years.  It's a very simple concept but a little tedious to create, which is why it took five years for me to start and finish it.  
You can input any legal expression (legal by the rules of symbolic logic) and then view its truth table or plug in your own TF values and evaluate the expression.
